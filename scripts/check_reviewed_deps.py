"""Fail if the crates compiled into the wasm differ from reviewed-deps.txt.

Usage: python3 scripts/check_reviewed_deps.py

Compares, for the wasm target and normal dependencies only (what ends up in the published binary
or runs as a proc-macro to build it), the set of (name, version, checksum) resolved by
Cargo.lock with the hand-reviewed list. Any added, removed or changed crate fails the check
until it has been reviewed and the list updated. Reads metadata only: builds nothing.
